🌟 How to Explain to Judges (Team Lead Approach)
🧑‍💼 Step 1 – Introduction:

“Our project, EVT — Every Visitor’s Trust, is an e-commerce platform built to represent not just sales, but trust. It combines strong frontend development using React.js, structured DBMS concepts, and modern UI design.”

💻 Step 2 – Technical Overview:

“We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js for the frontend, with LocalStorage simulating MySQL for database persistence.
I led the integration of all modules — from product rendering to cart and trust verification modals.”

⚙️ Step 3 – Demonstration Flow:

Show homepage with logo, tagline, and categories.

Click a category → show filtered products.

Add a product to cart → open cart sidebar.

Proceed to checkout → confirm order modal.

Login as admin → open DBMS Console → show SQL simulation.

Highlight “Safety & Trust” modal — explain it as EVT’s main USP.

✨ Step 4 – Closing Statement:

“Our goal wasn’t just to make another shopping site — but to build a trust-driven platform where every visitor feels secure. That’s why we named it Every Visitor’s Trust (EVT).”
